		<h1>Xenxier</h1>
		<h2>Welcome.</h2>
		<p>I am Benjamin Gwynn, this website that you are looking at is a small webpage on the internet to house information about the various projects I have created over time for the open-source community. Even this website is open source and written in the latest HTML5 standards, it's source code can be viewed <a href="view-source:http://xenxier.tk" style="link">here</a> if you're interested. If this website (or the previous link) isn't working or quite looking right then you probably need to <a href="http://chrome.google.com">update your browser</a> to one that <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20140429144402-54592984-7-reasons-not-to-use-internet-explorer-ever-ever-again">isn't Internet Explorer.</a> This website should be fully compatible in modern mobile browsers due to clever CSS. Give it a go.</p>

		<h1>Terms for the stuff I make</h1>
		<p>This is no legal print, but these points are generally just considered good etiquette to follow. It's worth mentioning that I may update this at any time.</p>
		<br></br>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>These points are not legally binding.</strong> This is not a contract or an agreement, this is just a pretty list.</li>
			<li><strong>If it stops working, I will try to help if I'm still working on it.</strong> I may still also try and lend a hand when I'm not.</li>
			<li><strong>If you got it for free, it's mine.</strong> You are free to modify and distribute the it as long as you do not profit from it and keep my name on it.</li>
			<li><strong>If you brought it from me, it's yours.</strong> You may do whatever you want with your said item, sell it and distribute it, use it for personal use, whatever. I'd like you to keep my name somewhere but I won't care too much if you got rid of it.</li>
			<li><strong>If we worked on it together, it's ours.</strong> We all keep a copy of our work and may update it, but keep the credit to the original other author(s) as we do so.</li>
