		<h1>Kenan Buckley</h1>
		<img src="kenan1.jpg">
		<p>Kenan was born October 20, 1971, at the Los Altos Hospital in Long Beach, California, the second of three sons. Named after his stepfather, Calvin Cordozar Buckley, Sr. (December 10, 1948 – November 9, 1985, Los Angeles), his mother is Beverly Buckley (née Tate; born April 27, 1951, McComb, Mississippi). His father, Vernall Varnado (born December 13, 1949, Magnolia, Mississippi), was a Vietnam veteran, singer, and mail carrier who was said to be frequently absent from his life. As a boy, his parents nicknamed him "Snoopy" because of his appearance, but they usually addressed him as Kenan at home. His mother and stepfather divorced in 1975.</p>
