HTML5: The Solar System

A complete recreation of our solar system in HTML5. Planet sizes, distances and orbit speeds are all accurate and can be used to show how the different planets rotate around our solar system. The project uses JSON to manage all the data of the planets, and SVG's to display them. The simulation is scalable and interactive.

HTML5: CLICK IT
This is a glorified click tester, featuring beautiful particles and a pretty colour cycling background. I also made this my first published Android app. I also have to thank *grnt* for complaining about an online click tester he was using and giving me the idea to create this.

HTML5: Pong
A pong game I coded in a very small space of time using the particles from particlebox after [REDACTED] asked if I could make a pong game. This game is two player, controlled with UP, DOWN and W, S.
