Particlebox
Particlebox is an experiment to try and create amazing looking particles in HTML5 canvas using only squares. Particlebox was originally a part of my website, but I've recently decided to clean it up and give it its own page below. Particlebox can be ran on mobile devices, but be warned that a lot of particles *will* put stress on your browser.

The Solar System

A complete recreation of our solar system in HTML5. Planet sizes, distances and orbit speeds are all accurate and can be used to show how the different planets rotate around our solar system. The project uses JSON to manage all the data of the planets, and SVG's to display them. The simulation is scalable and interactive.

CLICK IT
This is a glorified click tester, featuring beautiful particles and a pretty colour cycling background. I also made this my first published Android app. I also have to thank *grnt* for complaining about an online click tester he was using and giving me the idea to create this.

Pong
A pong game I coded in a very small space of time using the particles from particlebox after *[REDACTED]* asked if I could make a pong game. This game is two player, controlled with UP, DOWN and W, S.

Markdot
Markdot is a Javascript script which interprets a text file and converts it to HTML5 on-the-fly. It is fully HTML5 compliant and uses the standard structual elements from HTML, namely <article>, <section>, <header> and <footer>. This entire page was created using Markdot and is all editable via a single text file. If you want to learn more, check out the example I made.

Hi there, welcome to my website. I spend my time learning stuff, then waste that knowledge on making stupid little projects. This entire website and everything it links to was coded in HTML5, so it should all be pretty awesome. If you wish to contact me, then you may do so via the link below. The amazing background images I used for the cool CSS3 effect were made by /u/BloodyMarvellous on reddit.
