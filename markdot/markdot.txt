Mark*dot*
Making the web *simple* for writers, and *powerful* for designers.

Simple
The project is based off the concept that anybody should be able to edit a webpage's content with minimum training, and the idea that they shouldn't have to worry about breaking the sites design.

Powerful
Markdot renders a full HTML5 page, which allows web designers to do anything they normally could with CSS and Javascript.

Smart
Markdot is smart enough to automatically format a document with the correct headings, and supports standard *formatting of text*. Markdot also understands links and images, and will add them accordingly.

Compatible
Markdot automatically adds support for older browsers without native support for the HTML5 structual elements used.

Download
Markdot is still under construction, so it's not recommended that you try it out yet. Come back later (or rip the script from this page).
