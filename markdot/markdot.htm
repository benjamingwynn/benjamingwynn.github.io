		<h1>Simple</h1>
		<p>The project is based around the idea that anybody, without any training or experience, can edit and maintain the contents of a website without having to hassle their web designer to change it for them. The idea is simple, a single text document hosted somewhere that the owner of the site can change at any time.</p>

		<h1>Modern</h1>
		<p>The project is written in Javascript, and creates a full HTML5 page on load, allowing for element manipulation via Javascript, and complete customisation through CSS. There are no limitations.</p>
	</content>
	<content id="smart">
		<h1>Smart</h1>
		<h2>Quite Smart</h2>
		<p>The project is written to understand plain text with a basic format, it automatically correctly adds hyperlinks and images from the text, and attempts to correctly format the headings with the idea that headings do not end in a dot, or any other type of punctuation.</p>
		<h2>Really Smart</h2>
		<p>Markdot also supports subheaders based off of how English works.</p>
